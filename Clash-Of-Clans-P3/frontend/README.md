## APP DESCRIPTION
My app is called Clash of Clans Players Stats. This is an app for the players of Clash of Clans to go to and look up stats to any player in the game.  The home page will show them who the top 10 players of that week are.  The show page will show information of the current town hall level, trophies, and the units/ heros.  In the future, I would like to have a breakdown of what the different levels of heros/troops provied the player.  Along with a video on the home screen show casing the monthly community challenge attack.
